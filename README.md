# UCSB Web UI Kit 

Get the [ucsb.edu](https://www.ucsb.edu/) look and feel with CSS and snippets of HTML that will work in your website or web app.

This is a vanilla implementation of the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) visual identity guidelines and web theme.

The goal is to provide a single CSS file that can be imported and used in any website that wants to use UCSB styled components.

## Development Guidelines

### Code

- Indent : Use 2 spaces per indent. No tabs.

- EOF : Blank newline at end of files.

- Properties : Use full properiy names, no shortcuts.

- Colors : Use uppercase 6 digit hexidecimal.

### Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Any text editor can be used but this project will have a VS Code workspace file.

### Tech

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) : The newer Sassy CSS (SCSS) flavor.

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) : Try Node Version Manager for [Mac/Linux](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).



## Roadmap: plans, goals, hopes, and dreams

1. Convert styles from the ucsb.edu Drupal theme into standalone reusable CSS.

2. No external dependencies like Bootstrap. Use it anywhere.

3. Examples and snippits hosted on GitHub Pages. May convert to [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) later.

4. Package and publish on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ucsantabarbara). Use npm to install or [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) for CDN.
